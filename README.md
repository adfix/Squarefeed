# Squarefeed Google Shopping Ads
[Installation guide](https://squarefeed.io/m2-installation-guide-marketplace/)

## Overview

[SquareFeed](https://squarefeed.io/) helps merchants sell more using Google, Bing, Facebook and Instagram. Squarefeed started as an in-house software tool used by digital marketing experts. Having worked with hundreds of Magento merchants on building their ad campaigns we quickly realized that building a data feed that meets Google's requirements is not an easy task. After thousands of hours of testing and iterations we launched Squarefeed as a standalone, independent product that any Magento store owner can use to save time and market their products on various channels. 

[Google Shopping](https://www.google.com/retail/solutions/shopping-campaigns/) is one of the most effective forms of advertising for Magento merchants. But many ecommerce businesses struggle to start their Google Shopping Ads: because of products getting disapproved, links not working, incomplete product data, lack of knowledge in regards to Google Ads etc.

Manually data entry and messing around with complex user interfaces can be very frustrating. So instead of going back and forth with your developers, why not try the hassle free way: Google Shopping Ads by Squarefeed. 

The extension is powerful, yet versatile, it has an easy to use interface but it can handle a high number of SKUs. Unlike other product feed extensions, Google Shopping Ads by Squarefeed doesn’t put unnecessary stress on your server. This is because we splits up large product data in smaller chunks and then the data processing happens on our servers.

On top of that you don’t have leave the Magento admin to publish or edit your campaign. Also, once your campaign is live you can see reports, right in the Magento dashboard!

If your ever get stuck or need any advice in regards to your product feed or Google Shopping campaign, you can reach out to our support team.

The extension was designed by a team of experts with an agency background with a lot of experience managing Google Shopping Ads (formerly known as Product Listing Ads) for ecommerce websites of all sizes.

## Features

* Easy Product Data Feeds. Go live on Google Shopping, with a data feed that complies with [Google’s specifications](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7052112). We've built in a standard configuration logic that works for most Magento merchants. You can also fine tune the settings in just a few clicks. With our extension you can create a data feed in two ways:
    - Simple mode - you only need to answer 4 simple questions about your products and then you're all set.
    - Advanced mode - this allows more technical users to configure and map all the fields based on your preferences.
* One Click Connection To Google Merchant. After you create the feed, we save you time by sending the feed in your Google Merchant account with one click. We double check your tax and shipping settings, domain verification and we link up your Google Ads account as well.
* Launch Your Campaign From The Magento Admin. After your feed is ready, you can launch your Shopping campaign, right from the admin panel. Just enter your daily budget and you're all set. For technical users, our advanced mode allows you to configure different settings such as the bidding strategy and device bid adjustments.
* View Stats Without Logging Into Google Ads. After launching your campaign, you can view your stats in your Magento admin panel. You can also change your daily budget, adjust your bidding strategy and change your device bid adjustments right from the admin.
* Decide What Products You Want To Sync Using Filters. Want to remove certain items from the feed? No problem. Our filters feature allows you to remove items from your feed using conditional rules.
* Optimize Your Data Using Dynamic Attributes. Are you missing a required field in the feed or you need to optimize your titles? With our dynamic attributes you can:
    - Easily map your categories to Google’s taxonomy using our autocomplete fields
    - Extract text from a source field - this is useful when you have some date, but it’s not in the proper format. A good example would be when you don’t have a dedicated color attribute, but this information is available in the product name.
    - Set "if then than that" conditions - when you want to tag your products based on certain characteristics, such as if the description contains a certain word or based on the categories they are in.
    - Bulk import from spreadsheet - if you want to enter a custom attribute, without creating a dedicated field for it in Magento, you can simply upload a spreadsheet with the attribute value for each SKU.
* Avoid Running Expensive Queries On Your Own Server. Unlike most data feed extensions, all the data processing required for exporting the feed are done on our servers in order to minimize the impact on your website.
* Google Shopping Ads Is Built Specifically For Magento 2. Our extension is fully compatible with Magento 2.
* Compatible With Configurable And Grouped Products. Google requires you to send variant product information in your feed, however depending on your store setup you might need to use certain fields from your configurable or grouped products. This is possible using our advanced product settings feature, you can simply select a parent product field when needed.
